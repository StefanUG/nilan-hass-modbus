# Home Assistant Nilan Modbus Configuration

This repo contains configuration files to make connect your Nilan ventilation system to Home Assistant using the Modbus integration and a cheap modbus USB stick.

The configuration included in this project is for my Nilan Comfort CT 300. It will most likely work with most units that have a CTS602 controller. But the configuraiton may differ for your unit.

### Inspiration

My inspiration for this project include:

* Thanks to [jascdk](https://github.com/jascdk/Nilan_Homeassistant) for giving me idea to connect Nilan to Home Assistant in the first place.
* Thanks to [DanGunvald](https://github.com/DanGunvald/NilanModbus) for sharing his Arduino code which gave me a bigger understanding of the Modbus registers in the CTS602 and how to control it.
* Thanks to [jakobmoll](https://gist.github.com/jakobmoll/c29877d584cc6970e6316173a6e4b561) for sharing his configuration for a Modbus integration setup with his Nilan, although his configuration is quite different from the one required for the CTS602 controller.
